# Pandas Challenge
Analysis of school and standardized test data using manipulation of pandas DataFrames. Results show that the higher amount of money that a school is spending on each student, does not result in higher testing scores. In fact, it is the opposite. Additionally, smaller schools outperformed larger schools on reading, math, and a combined passing percentage of both subject areas. Charter schools are shown to deliver higher test scores over district schools as well. 
 
## Technologies:
Python, pandas

## Data Source:
Data found in schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv.
